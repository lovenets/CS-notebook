#### 1.[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Solution**

1.Brute Force

Check all the substring one by one to see if it has no duplicate character.

```go
func lengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
	length := len(s)
	max := 0
	for i := 0; i < length; i++ {
		for j := i + 1; j <= length; j++ {
			if allUnique(s, i, j) {
				if max < j-i {
					max = j - i
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return max
}

func allUnique(s string, start int, end int) bool {
	chars := make(map[uint8]bool)
	for i := start; i < end; i++ {
		if chars[s[i]] {
			return false
		} else {
			chars[s[i]] = true
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(n^3)$$

To verify if characters within index range $$[i, j)$$ are all unique, we need to scan all of them. Thus, it costs $$O(j - i)$$ time.

For a given `i`, the sum of time costed by each $$j \in [i+1, n]$$ is $$\sum_{i+1}^{n}O(j - i)$$

Thus, the sum of all the time consumption is:

$$O\left(\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\left(\sum_{j = i + 1}^{n}(j - i)\right)\right) = O\left(\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\frac{(1 + n - i)(n - i)}{2}\right) = O(n^3)$$

2.Sliding Window

A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string problems. A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices, i.e. $$[i, j)$$ (left-closed, right-open). A sliding window is a window "slides" its two boundaries to the certain direction. For example, if we slide $$[i, j)$$ to the right by 1 element, then it becomes $$[i+1, j+1)$$ (left-closed, right-open).

In the naive approaches, we repeatedly check a substring to see if it has duplicate character. But it is unnecessary. If a substring $$s_{ij}$$ from index $$i$$ to $$jâˆ’1$$ is already checked to have no duplicate characters. We only need to check if $$s[j]$$ is already in the substring $$s_{ij}$$.

We use hash table to store the characters in current window $$[i, j)$$($$j=i$$ initially). The key is the character and the value is the current index of this character. Then we slide the index $$j$$ to the right. If it is not in the hash table, we slide $$j$$ further. Doing so until s[j] is already in the hash table. At this point, we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters start with index $$i$$. If we do this for all $$i$$, we get our answer.

if $$s[j]$$ have a duplicate in the range $$[i, j)$$ with index $$j'$$, we don't need to increase $$i$$ little by little. We can skip all the elements in the range $$[i, j']$$ and let $$i$$ to be $$j' + 1$$ directly.

```go
func lengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
	if len(s) == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	chars := make(map[rune]int)
	max := 0
	i := 0
	for i, v := range s {
		if j, ok := chars[v]; ok {
			// assure that left pointer moves forward
			if i < j+1 {
				i = j + 1
			}
		}
		chars[v] = i
		// update the length of substring
		if max < i-j+1 {
			max = i - j + 1
		}
	}
	return max
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(n)$$

#### 2.[Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern)

Given a `pattern` and a string `str`, find if `str` follows the same pattern.

Here **follow** means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern`and a **non-empty** word in `str`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false
```

**Notes:**
You may assume `pattern` contains only lowercase letters, and `str` contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

**Solution**

```go
func wordPattern(pattern string, str string) bool {
   words := strings.Split(str, " ")
   if len(words) != len(pattern) {
      return false
   }
   // go through the pattern letters and words in parallel
   // compare the indices where they appeared last time
   patternIndex := make(map[uint8]int)
   wordIndex := make(map[string]int)
   for i := 0; i < len(words); i++ {
      i1,ok1 := patternIndex[pattern[i]]
      i2,ok2 := wordIndex[words[i]]
      if ok1 == ok2 {
         if i1 != i2 {
            return false
         }
         patternIndex[pattern[i]] = i
         wordIndex[words[i]] = i
      } else {
         return false
      }
   }
   return true
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, n is the length of `str`.

#### 3.[Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Given a list of daily temperatures `T`, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put `0` instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures `T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`, your output should be `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.

**Note:** The length of `temperatures` will be in the range `[1, 30000]`. Each temperature will be an integer in the range `[30, 100]`.

(1) hash table

The range of temperature is quite small, so it is possible to have a hash map of temperatures to earliest days when that temperature occurred.

We iterate through the list of temperatures from the back, and for each day, loop through higher temperatures and find the minimum day for existing higher temperatures.

Example, for the input, when we are at 72

```
[73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
                      ^
# We have the following hash map:
{
  73: 7,
  76: 6,
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] T) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> temps = new HashMap<>();
        int[] res = new int[T.length];
        // iterate the array from back to front
        for (int i = T.length - 1; i > -1; i--) {
            int t = T[i];
            // use a list to store the distances between current and higher temperatures
            List<Integer> days = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int higher = t + 1; higher <= 100; higher++) {
                if (temps.containsKey(higher)) {
                    days.add(temps.get(higher) - i);
                }
            }
            if (!days.isEmpty()) {
                res[i] = days.stream().min(Comparator.naturalOrder()).get();
            }
            // update the closet position where current temperature appears
            temps.put(t, i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, n is the number of temperatures.

(2) stack

```java
public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    int[] ret = new int[temperatures.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
        while(!stack.isEmpty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack.peek()]) {
            int idx = stack.pop();
            ret[idx] = i - idx;
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }
    return ret;
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, n is the number of temperatures.

Since popping and pushing is time-consuming, we can use an array to stimulate stack.

```java
public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
    int[] stack = new int[temperatures.length];
    int top = -1;
    int[] ret = new int[temperatures.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
        while(top > -1 && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[top]]) {
            int idx = stack[top--];
            ret[idx] = i - idx;
        }
        stack[++top] = i;
    }
    return ret;
}
```

#### 4. [Array of Doubled Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-of-doubled-pairs/)

Given an array of integers `A` with even length, return `true` if and only if it is possible to reorder it such that `A[2 * i + 1] = 2 * A[2 * i]` for every `0 <= i < len(A) / 2`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,1,3,6]
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,1,2,6]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [4,-2,2,-4]
Output: true
Explanation: We can take two groups, [-2,-4] and [2,4] to form [-2,-4,2,4] or [2,4,-2,-4].
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: [1,2,4,16,8,4]
Output: false
```

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length <= 30000`
2. `A.length` is even
3. `-100000 <= A[i] <= 100000`

**Solution**

**Let's see a simple case**
Assume all interger are positive, for example `[2,4,4,8]`.
We have one `x = 2`, we need to match it with one `2x = 4`.
Then one `4` is gone, we have the other `x = 4`.
We need to match it with one `2x = 8`.
Finally no number left.

**Why we start from 2?**
Because it's the smallest and we no there is no `x/2` left.
So we know we need to find `2x`

**What if the case negative?**
One way is that start from the biggest (with smallest absolute value),
and we apply the same logic.

Another way is that start from the smallest (with biggest absolute value ), and we try to find `x/2` each turn.

```go
func canReorderDoubled(A []int) bool {
	counter := make(map[int]int)
	for _, val := range A {
		counter[val]++
	}
	// we need to traverse the map
	// from the smallest key to the biggest key
	keys := make([]int, 0)
	for k := range counter {
		keys = append(keys, k)
	}
	sort.Ints(keys)

	for _, k := range keys {
        // we have completed matching a number
		if counter[k] == 0 {
			continue
		}
		var want int
		if k < 0 {
			// if k is negative then k is A[2*i+1]
			want = k / 2
		} else {
            // if k is positive then k is A[2*i]
			want = k * 2
		}
		if (k < 0 && k%2 != 0) || counter[k] > counter[want] {
			return false
		}
		counter[want] = counter[want] - counter[k]
	}
	return true
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(Max{K,N})$$, K is the number of distinct numbers and N is the number of total numbers.

 #### 5.[Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum)

In an array `A` of `0`s and `1`s, how many **non-empty** subarrays have sum `S`?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The 4 subarrays are bolded below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
```

**Note:**

1. `A.length <= 30000`
2. `0 <= S <= A.length`
3. `A[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

**Solution**

Here are two important basic ideas to go through the algorithm:

(1) Let `P[i] = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i-1]`. Then `P[j+1] - P[i] = A[i] + A[i+1] + ... + A[j]`, the sum of the subarray `[i, j]`. **This is a very important idea to solve this kind of problem. **

(2) Subarrays are **continuous**. 

Let's say now we arrive `A[j]`in array `A`and `P[j]>=S`, so if we can find the number of subarrays summing to `P[j]-S`then we will find the number of subarrays, **which end at index `j`**, summing to S. We can subtract `P[j+1]`by`P[i]`to get `S`. Since subarrays are continuous, extract a smaller subarray from a larger subarray then we will surely get another subarray as long as the two subarrays end at the same position. 

```go
func numSubarraysWithSum(A []int, S int) int {
    // count[i] means unitl now we know there are count[i]
    // subarrays summing to i
	psum, res, count := 0, 0, make(map[int]int)
	count[0] = 1
	for _, val := range A {
		psum += val
		if psum >= S {
			res += count[psum-S]
		}
		count[psum]++
	}
	return res
}
```

Using slice instead of map may be faster.

```go
func numSubarraysWithSum(A []int, S int) int {
    psum, res, count := 0, 0, make([]int, len(A)+1)
	count[0] = 1
	for _, val := range A {
		psum += val
		if psum >= S {
			res += count[psum-S]
		}
		count[psum]++
	}
	return res
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, n is the length of `A`.

#### 6. [Brick Wall](https://leetcode.com/problems/brick-wall/)

There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the **top** to the **bottom** and cross the **least** bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.

**You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.**

**Example:**

```
Input: [[1,2,2,1],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,2],
        [2,4],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,1,1]]

Output: 2
```

Explanation: ![explanation](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/brick_wall.png)

**Note:**

1. The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
2. The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.

**Solution**

This is very tricky. We want to cut from the edge of the most common location among all the levels, hence using a map to record the locations and their corresponding occurrence. Moreover, we can not just draw a line across the wall edge so we skip the last brick in every level. 

```go
func leastBricks(wall [][]int) int {
	if len(wall) == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	count := 0
	edges := make(map[int]int)
	for _, level := range wall {
		width := 0
        // skip the last brick in every level
		for i := 0; i < len(level)-1; i++ {
			width += level[i]
			edges[width]++
			if count < edges[width] {
				count = edges[width]
			}
		}
	}
	return len(wall) - count
}

```

Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$

#### 7. [Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array)

Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

**Note:** The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.

**Solution**

Use this problem directly using hash map and prefix sum. Change 0 in the original array to 1 then calculate the prefix sum. If `sum[0, i] == sum[0, j]`, we can know that there are equal 0 and 1 in the subarray `[i + 1, j]`. We can use a hash map to accelerate the process by mapping sum to its corresponding index.

```go
func findMaxLength(nums []int) int {
    sum2index := make(map[int]int)
    sum2index[0] = -1
    sum, res := 0, 0 
    for i, v := range nums {
        if v == 0 {
            sum--
        } else {
            sum++
        }
        if j, ok := sum2index[sum]; ok {
            if i - j > res {
                res = i - j
            }
        } else {
            sum2index[sum] = i
        }
    }
    return res
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, n is the length of array.

#### 8. [Design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/)

Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow another user and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the user's news feed. Your design should support the following methods:

1. **postTweet(userId, tweetId)**: Compose a new tweet.
2. **getNewsFeed(userId)**: Retrieve the 10 most recent tweet ids in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user herself. Tweets must be ordered from most recent to least recent.
3. **follow(followerId, followeeId)**: Follower follows a followee.
4. **unfollow(followerId, followeeId)**: Follower unfollows a followee.

**Example:**

```
Twitter twitter = new Twitter();

// User 1 posts a new tweet (id = 5).
twitter.postTweet(1, 5);

// User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5].
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);

// User 1 follows user 2.
twitter.follow(1, 2);

// User 2 posts a new tweet (id = 6).
twitter.postTweet(2, 6);

// User 1's news feed should return a list with 2 tweet ids -> [6, 5].
// Tweet id 6 should precede tweet id 5 because it is posted after tweet id 5.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);

// User 1 unfollows user 2.
twitter.unfollow(1, 2);

// User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5],
// since user 1 is no longer following user 2.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);
```

**Solution**

#### 9. [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

**Example:**

```
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

**Note:**

- All inputs will be in lowercase.
- The order of your output does not matter.

**Solution**

(1) straightforward 

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun groupAnagrams(strs: Array<String>): List<List<String>> {
        // key: character -> frequency, value: word
        val map = mutableMapOf<MutableMap<Char, Int>, MutableList<String>>()
        strs.forEach {
            val charToCount = mutableMapOf<Char, Int>()
            it.forEach { c -> charToCount[c] = charToCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1 }
            // update the map
            map.computeIfAbsent(charToCount) { mutableListOf() }.add(it)
        }
        return map.values.toList()
    }
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$

(2) another way to generate keys 

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun groupAnagrams(strs: Array<String>): List<List<String>> {
        if (strs.isEmpty()) return listOf()
        val map = mutableMapOf<String, MutableList<String>>()
        strs.forEach {
            val key = java.lang.String.valueOf(it.toCharArray().sorted())
            map.computeIfAbsent(key) { mutableListOf() }.add(it)
        }
        return map.values.toList()
    }
}

#### 10. [Implement Magic Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-magic-dictionary)

Implement a magic directory with `buildDict`, and `search` methods.

For the method `buildDict`, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.

For the method `search`, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify **exactly**one character into **another** character in this word, the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
Input: search("hello"), Output: False
Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
Input: search("hell"), Output: False
Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.
2. For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
3. Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are **persisted across multiple test cases**. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/#different-output) for more details.

**Solution**

(1)

1. For each word in `dict`, for each char, remove the char and put the rest of the word as key, a pair of index of the removed char and the char as `part of` value list into a map. e.g.
   "hello" -> {"ello":[[0, 'h']], "hllo":[[1, 'e']], "helo":[[2, 'l'],[3, 'l']], "hell":[[4, 'o']]}
2. During search, generate the keys as in step 1. When we see there's pair of same index but different char in the value array, we know the answer is true. e.g.
   "healo" when remove `a`, key is "helo" and there is a pair [2, 'l'] which has same index but different char. Then the answer is true.

The solution is very space consuming.

```kotlin
class MagicDictionary() {
    private val map = mutableMapOf<String, MutableList<IntArray>>()

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */

    /** Build a dictionary through a list of words */
    fun buildDict(dict: Array<String>) {
        dict.forEach {
            for (i in it.indices) {
                val key = it.removeRange(i, i + 1)
                val pair = intArrayOf(i, it[i].toInt())
                map.computeIfAbsent(key) { mutableListOf() }.add(pair)
            }
        }
    }

    /** Returns if there is any word in the trie that equals to the given word after modifying exactly one character */
    fun search(word: String): Boolean {
        for (i in word.indices) {
            val key = word.removeRange(i, i + 1)
            map[key]?.forEach {
                if (it[0] == i && it[1] != word[i].toInt()) {
                    return true
                }
            }
        }
        return false
    }
}
```

A word `'apple'` has neighbors `'*pple', 'a*ple', 'ap*le', 'app*e', 'appl*'`. When searching for a target word like `'apply'`, we know that a necessary condition is a neighbor of `'apply'` is a neighbor of some source word in our magic dictionary. If there is more than one source word that does this, then at least one of those source words will be different from the target word so the result it true. Otherwise, we need to check that the source doesn't equal the target.

```kotlin
class MagicDictionary() {
    private val words = mutableSetOf<String>()

    private val near = mutableMapOf<String, Int>()

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */

    /** Build a dictionary through a list of words */
    fun buildDict(dict: Array<String>) {
        words.addAll(dict)
        dict.forEach {
            candidate(it).forEach { cand ->
                near[cand] = near.getOrDefault(cand, 0) + 1
            }
        }
    }

    /** Returns if there is any word in the trie that equals to the given word after modifying exactly one character */
    fun search(word: String): Boolean {
        return candidate(word).any {
            near.containsKey(it) && (near[it]!! > 1 || (near[it] == 1 && !words.contains(word)))
        }
    }

    private fun candidate(word: String): List<String> {
        val cand = mutableListOf<String>()
        for (i in word.indices) {
            cand.add(word.replaceRange(i, i + 1, "*"))
        }
        return cand
    }
}
```

```go
type MagicDictionary struct {
	Words map[string]bool
	Near  map[string]int

#### 11. [Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-repeated-subarray/)

Given two integer arrays `A` and `B`, return the maximum length of an subarray that appears in both arrays.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
A: [1,2,3,2,1]
B: [3,2,1,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].
```

**Note:**

1. 1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000
2. 0 <= A[i], B[i] < 100

**Solution**

This is a dynamic programming problem. 

```go
func findLength(A []int, B []int) int {
    if len(A) == 0 || len(B) == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    m, n, max := len(A), len(B), 0
    // dp[i][j] is the max length of common subarray ending at A[i] and B[j]
    // if A[i] == B[j], dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j]+1
    dp := make([][]int, m+1)
    for i := range dp {
        dp[i] = make([]int, n+1)

                dp[i][j] = 0
            } else {
                if A[i-1] == B[j-1] {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
                    if max < dp[i][j] {
                        max = dp[i][j]
                    }
                }
            }

#### 12. [Most Frequent Subtree Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-subtree-sum/)

Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

**Examples 1**
Input:

```
  5
 /  \
2   -3
```

return [2, -3, 4], since all the values happen only once, return all of them in any order.

**Examples 2**
Input:

```
  5
 /  \
2   -5
```

return [2], since 2 happens twice, however -5 only occur once.

**Note:** You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

**Solution**

Calculate the sum of every subtree while postorder traversing. 

```go
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Left *TreeNode
 *     Right *TreeNode
 * }
 */
func findFrequentTreeSum(root *TreeNode) []int {
    maxCount := 0
    sumToCount := make(map[int]int)
    
    postorder(root, &maxCount, sumToCount)
    
    res := make([]int, 0)
    for k := range sumToCount {
        if sumToCount[k] == maxCount {
            res = append(res, k)
        }
    }
    return res
}

func postorder(root *TreeNode, maxCount *int, sumToCount map[int]int) int {
    if root == nil {
        return 0
    }
    
    sum := root.Val + postorder(root.Left, maxCount, sumToCount) + postorder(root.Right, maxCount, sumToCount)
    sumToCount[sum]++
    if sumToCount[sum] > *maxCount {
        *maxCount = sumToCount[sum]
    }
    return sum
}
```

```kotlin
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode(var `val`: Int = 0) {
 *     var left: TreeNode? = null
 *     var right: TreeNode? = null
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private val count = mutableMapOf<Int, Int>()

    fun findFrequentTreeSum(root: TreeNode?): IntArray {
        if (root == null) {
            return IntArray(0)
        }
        getSum(root)
        val maxCount = count.values.max()
        return count.filter { it.value == maxCount }.keys.toIntArray()
    }

    private fun getSum(node: TreeNode?): Int {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0
        }
        val sum = getSum(node.left) + getSum(node.right) + node.`val`
        count[sum] = count.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1
        return sum
    }
}
```

#### 13. [Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
```

**Solution**

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun findRepeatedDnaSequences(s: String): List<String> {
        val seen = mutableSetOf<String>()
        val repeated = mutableSetOf<String>()
        for (i in 0 until s.length - 9) {
            val str = s.substring(i, i + 10)
            if (!seen.add(str)) {
                repeated.add(str)
            }
        }
        return repeated.toList()
    }

#### 14. [Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/)

In English, we have a concept called `root`, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word `successor`. For example, the root `an`, followed by `other`, which can form another word `another`.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the `successor` in the sentence with the `root` forming it. If a `successor` has many `roots` can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

**Note:**

1. The input will only have lower-case letters.
2. 1 <= dict words number <= 1000
3. 1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
4. 1 <= root length <= 100
5. 1 <= sentence words length <= 1000

**Solution**

straightforward

```go
func replaceWords(dict []string, sentence string) string {
    words := strings.Split(sentence, " ")
    for i := range words {
        rootLength := len(words[i])
        for _, root := range dict {
            if strings.HasPrefix(words[i], root) {
                if l := len(root); l < rootLength {
                    words[i] = root
                    rootLength = l
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return strings.Join(words, " ")
}
```

Time complexity: $$O(nm)$$, n is the number of words in the sentence and m is the length of `dict`.

Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ n is the number of words in the sentence.

More concise code using FP:

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun replaceWords(dict: List<String>, sentence: String): String {
        val roots = dict.toSet()
        return sentence
            .split(" ").joinToString(" ") {
                for (i in 1 until it.length) {
                    val prefix = it.substring(0, i)
                    if (roots.contains(prefix)) {
                        return@joinToString prefix
                    }
                }
                return@joinToString it
            }
    }
}
```

#### 15. [Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency)

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

**Solution**

(1) Bucket Sort

```go
func frequencySort(s string) string {
    // Count frequency of every character
    chToFreq := make(map[rune]int)
    for _, c := range s {
        chToFreq[c]++
    }
    // Get characters of every possible frequnecy 
    freqToCh := make(map[int][]rune)
    maxFreq := 0
    for c, f := range chToFreq {
        if _, ok := freqToCh[f]; !ok {
            freqToCh[f] = make([]rune, 0)
        }
        freqToCh[f] = append(freqToCh[f], c)
        if f > maxFreq {
            maxFreq = f
        }
    }
    // Construct output string
    var res string
    for i := maxFreq; i > 0; i-- {
        if _, ok := freqToCh[i]; ok {
            for j := range freqToCh[i] {
                res += strings.Repeat(string(freqToCh[i][j]), i)
            } 
        }
    }
    return res
}
```

        s.forEach { map[it] = map.getOrDefault(it, 0) + 1 }
        // Sorted by character frequency
        val pq = java.util.PriorityQueue<Map.Entry<Char, Int>> { a, b -> b.value - a.value }
